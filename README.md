## üßê Problem Statement <a name="#problem-statement"> </a>

* `Storage providers` and utility protocols are critical components of the filecoin ecosystem because they provide a variety of critical services to filecoin users. Storage providers are currently viewed as individual, single-person entities providing **provable storage** services via the `filecoin market place` in the current filecoin ecosystem.
* Storage providers do not consider the possibility of `multiple storage providers` providing storage as service in the form of a single entity.
* Other than this filecoin also lacks utility protocols that are built directly on filecoin and provide provable storage on the filecoin chain.

This limits the potential of filecoin and makes it difficult for teams to shift to filecoin and work to their full potential.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name="#idea"> </a>

- **MoonDAO**, which is built on top of `F(E)VM` is one stop solution, to above problems and provides extensive features as stated below.

- MoonDAO gives a complete infrastructure for organisations/ DOAs/ groups of storage providers to completely shift their day to day operations to the Hyperspace testnet.

- MoonDAO is a decentralized platform built using filecoin virtual machine that that leverages filecoin storage providers to provides a 
digital workspace for startups, businesses and data DAOs to mainly  store, manage their files securely and create sharable pages to sell their data.
