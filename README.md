## üßê Problem Statement <a name="#problem-statement"> </a>

* Currently DataDaos, startups, bussinesses have to use multiple apps like google drive, slack/discord, zoom/ google meet and third party market places to see their pervices or products which is very inefficient process. MoonDao is one stop solution to this it provides file encryption , decryption , sharing , chating , video conferring and much more.
* Some extra features that are new with MoonDao are creation of dynamic listing pages through which data daos can sell their data and they can share or advertise links of this page where ever they want. Other than that all the organisations that are made on moondao are soulbound token gated thus creator of an org nees to issue an soul bound token from his organisation on moon dao to new member 

This limits the potential of filecoin and makes it difficult for teams to shift to filecoin and work to their full potential.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name="#idea"> </a>

- **MoonDAO**, which is built on top of `F(E)VM` is one stop solution, to above problems and provides extensive features as stated below.

- MoonDAO gives a complete infrastructure for organisations/ DOAs/ groups of storage providers to completely shift their day to day operations to the Hyperspace testnet.

- MoonDAO is a decentralized platform built using filecoin virtual machine that that leverages filecoin storage providers to provides a 
digital workspace for startups, businesses and data DAOs to mainly  store, manage their files securely and create sharable pages to sell their data.
